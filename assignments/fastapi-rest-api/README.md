# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to build and test RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. You will create endpoints, handle requests and responses, and explore basic API concepts.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Create a Simple FastAPI Application

#### Description
Set up a FastAPI project and create a basic API with at least two endpoints (e.g., GET and POST).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Use FastAPI to create an API server
- Implement a GET endpoint that returns a welcome message
- Implement a POST endpoint that accepts JSON data and returns a response
- Run locally and be accessible via browser or API client

### 🛠️ Add Data Models and Validation

#### Description
Define Pydantic models for request and response data, and add validation to your endpoints.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Use Pydantic models for request/response schemas
- Validate incoming data and return appropriate error messages
- Document endpoints using FastAPI's automatic docs (Swagger UI)

### 🛠️ (Optional) Expand Your API

#### Description
Add more endpoints or features, such as updating or deleting data, or connecting to a database.

#### Requirements
Completed program could:
- Implement PUT or DELETE endpoints
- Store data in-memory or with a database
- Add authentication or custom error handling
