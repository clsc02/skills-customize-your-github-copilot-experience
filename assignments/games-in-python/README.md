# 📘 Assignment: Hangman Game

## 🎯 Objective

Build a classic Hangman game in Python. You'll practice string manipulation, loops, conditionals, and random selection by creating a word-guessing game where players try to reveal a hidden word before running out of attempts.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️	Create the Hangman Game

#### Description
Write a Python program that lets a player guess letters to reveal a randomly chosen word. The game should track correct and incorrect guesses, display progress, and end with a win or lose message.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select a word from a predefined list
- Accept letter guesses from the user
- Display current progress using underscores for unguessed letters (e.g., _ a _ _ m a n)
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining
- End the game when the word is fully guessed or attempts are exhausted
- Show a win message if the player guesses the word, or a lose message if they run out of attempts

### 🛠️	Enhance the Game (Optional)

#### Description
Add extra features to make your Hangman game more fun and challenging.

#### Requirements
Completed program could:

- Allow the player to choose difficulty (number of attempts)
- Show previously guessed letters
- Add ASCII art for the hangman
- Allow replaying the game without restarting the program
